Python Basics:
• Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the
sum of all even numbers in the list.
• Implement Merge Sort algorithm in Python.
o Input:
§ The input to the function merge_sort(arr) is a list arr containing
integers. The list may contain duplicates, and its length can vary
from 0 to N, where N is a positive integer.
o Output:
§ The function should return a new list containing the elements of
the input list arr sorted in ascending order using the Merge Sort
algorithm.
o Example
§ Input arr = [12, 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 10]
§ Output arr = [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12]
• Analyze the time complexity of the MergeSort implementation and discuss its
efficiency compared to other sorting algorithms.
