'''
    Analyze the time complexity of the MergeSort implementation and discuss its efficiency compared to other sorting algorithms.
'''

For merge sort is considered as Big O(n log n) in average case where by the arrary/list is diveded into smaller sub-sets of the array/list and compared against the subdivided arrays.

while Insertion, bubble and selection is considered as Big O(n ^ 2) as an avarage case, where the array/list is looped through to find the desired value.

This makes merge sort the best case senario from other sorting algorithms for larger subsets data or elements in a list/array where by the data is splited and compared against each other.
